 * Hence the distance can decrease over time, and it is the responsibility
 * of the user of this queue to propagate this change. This is usually in line with
 * what the parametric algorithm is doing anyway (the distance can change only if
 * a new path is discovered but if a new path is discovered, the information about parameter
 * change needs to be propagated).
